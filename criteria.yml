asset.ownerId:
  # don't remove this line unless you want (potentially) different users to have their
  # photos stacked together. this is a super basic regex that just captures the entire
  # string, no matter the contents. this way, the entire ownerId must be the same in order
  # for photos to be stacked together. feel free to use this regex elsewhere.
